```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

# libraries
```{r include=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(rmarkdown)
library(knitr)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggm)
theme_set(theme_minimal())
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
